INTRODUCTION

This presentation outlines the development and implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automating the deployment of a website from GitHub to a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline leverages a variety of tools including Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes to create a streamlined, efficient process that ensures the web application is continuously integrated, deployed, and updated based on changes to the source code repository.
